				<h3><i>Hell Below</i></h3>
				<h4><i>"The Perpetual Flame" - Kristin Hayter</i></h4>

						<p><i>The memory of the Centralia that was, exists in stark contrast to the Centralia we see today. The town began as a prosperous community made up of miners and their families. At that point in time no one could have foreseen what the land would later become. </i></p>
						<p><i>Trouble began in late May 1962, following the routine cleanup of a local landfill, and what was thought to be a controlled burning of rubbish. Residents noticed high ground temperatures, thinking nothing of it at first. Concern soon escalated and locals panicked when gasoline stored in underground tanks began giving temperature readings higher than ever before.   </i></p>
						<p><i>“That year, mayor and gas station owner John Coddington was checking the fuel levels of his underground tanks when he discovered that the gasoline had been heated to 172 degrees Fahrenheit.” according to Atlas Obscura’s article written by Ella Morton titled, “How an Underground Fire Destroyed an Entire Town.” Although the most probable cause, there is much debate about whether the burning of the landfill is to blame for the fire that would overtake the town. </i></p>
						<p><i>The Borough Council set out to stifle the fire any way they could. They began funding major excavation projects. Holes were drilled to allow water to be poured into the coal seams, and ventilation shafts were installed. All their efforts were in vain however, as they were ultimately unsuccessful in stopping the fire and it spread wildly out of control.  </i></p>
						<p><i>With no funding left allotted to Centralia to attempt more excavations, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth abandoned the effort. Subsequently, the people of Centralia were forced to evacuate and over the next few decades the population dwindled. </i></p>
						<p><i>In February of 2012, the few residents who remained received cash settlements in response to a lawsuit brought by the Borough Council President who led the push for the remaining residents to keep their land regardless of the dangers that persist. The agreement that was reached rewarded the residents with $218,000 in compensation for their homes and the right to remain in Centralia until their deaths. </i></p>
						<p><i>“Once they pass away, the rights of their properties will be taken through eminent domain,” stated Dan Ratchford in his article on wnep.com, published Oct. 30, 2013.</i></p>
