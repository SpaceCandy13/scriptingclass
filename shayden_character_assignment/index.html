		<i>"I thought you wanted a little danger." - Star Butterfly</i>
		<img src="images/star_butterfly.png" alt="star butterfly">
		<p>Princess Star Butterfly is the excitable, rebellious, teenage heir to the throne of the Butterfly Kingdom. Although she is meant to become a wise and well-mannered ruler one day, Star would much rather fight bad guys and party with her friends. Her destructive tendencies are of great concern to her parents and in lieu of sending her to a princess reform school they instead send her to Earth as an exchange student, where she is left in the care of the <i>Diaz</i> family. Although Star is by nature reckless and impulsive, over time she grows to understand her kingdom's volatile relationship with the monster races that also inhabit the dimension and chooses to take action. Eventually she sets to work righting the wrongs of the past rulers and campaigns to unify all monsters and mewmans.  </p>

			<h3 class="fancy">Magical Abilities</h3>
				<i>"Yeah. Magic's Weird. Wanna blow it up?" - Star Butterfly</i>
				<p>Star's dimension is one where magic is common practice, however the strength of a mewman's magic depends on many different factors. In the case of Star Butterfly, her magic is her birthright as a princess of the royal family. Traditionally, all heirs to the throne receive a <i>magic wand</i> as well as a <i>magical instruction book</i>of great importance, that they must learn to wield to protect their kingdom. Each heir also receives the guidance of Sir Glossaryck, a seemingly immortal magical being who assists the royal family in understanding their abilities. Star is also unique in that she can use her <i>innate powers</i> to amplify the magic from her wand, over time this power becomes the basis of her full transformation state. </p>
		
			<div>
				<h3>Magic Wand</h3>
				<img src="images/royal_wand.webp" alt="royal wand">
				<p>Star's wand is a magical family heirloom that takes on the appearance of its wielder's magical aesthetic. Using verbal spells, she is able to bend reality and fabricate creatures to fight with her and annihilate her foes. </p>
			</div>
		
			<div>
				<h3>Sir Glossaryck &amp; The Magic Instruction Book</h3>
				<img src="images/glossaryck.jpg" alt="Glossaryck">
				<p>Sir Glossaryck is the <i>usually unhelpful</i> magical guide that is meant to encourage Star to create her own forms of magic and learn the proper ways to use her wand and her ancestor's spells as shown in the Magical Instruction Book. Unfortunately, Sir Glossaryck is morally questionable and can be bribed easily with pudding allowing Star to do anything she wants. </p>
			</div>
		
			<div>
				<h3>Innate Magical Abilities: Ultimate Form</h3>
				<img src="images/ultimate_star.jpg" alt="Star Butterfly Magical Girl">
				<p>Star's magical form is hinted on throughout the series but only really shown while she was experiencing mewberty- that is the mewman's version of puberty- and does not reach its full potential until much later. While in this form Star has the power of flight and takes on a butterfly-like appearance. </p>
			</div>

	<section id="friends">
				<h3 class="fancy">Friendships</h3>
				<i>"I can have two best friends. Unless one of them is a friend-ditching liar." - Star</i>
				<img src="images/star_friends.webp" alt="Star, Marco, Tom, Ponyhead">
				<p>Throughout all of Star's adventures, her loyal friends always have her back. Even though they are all from different worlds and dimensions they always show up when Star needs them the most. Star's friends may not always get along with one another, they will pull out all the stops to help her reach her goals. When they are not fighting evil and overthrowing kingdoms, Star and her friends enjoy attending parties, concerts, and spending holidays together.  </p>
		
		
		<div>
				<h3>Marco Diaz</h3>
			<i>"Luckily, the cactuses broke my fall." - Marco</i>
				<img src="images/star_marco.png" alt="Star, Marco">
				<p>Marco Diaz is the son of Rafael Diaz and Angie Diaz, and the older brother of Mariposa Diaz. When Star was sent to live in the human world, she was entrusted to Marco to help her learn about human customs. Marco quickly becomes Star's closest friend and confidant. The two are soon virtually inseparable, experiencing all the highs and lows of teenagerhood together. Although he is human and without magical abilities, Marco is a capable Karate student and a quick thinker, making him an excellent <i>battle buddy</i> to Star. </p>
				
		</div>
		<div>
				<h3>PonyHead</h3>
			<i>"Kids... You have 'em, and then you... wish they werent't around." - King Pony Head</i>
			<img src="images/ponyhead.webp" alt="Star, Ponyhead">
				<p>A bad influence is how Star's mother would describe Ponyhead. Voted most likely to end up in reform school, Ponyhead is the rambunctious teenage daughter of the royal Pony Head family. The Pony Heads rule the Cloud Kingdom in outer space. Star and Ponyhead are usually in trouble when they are together and spend most of their time partying. As Star's oldest friend, Ponyhead is often jealous of Marco and takes any and all opportunity to whisk Star away for a weekend of fun filled dimension hopping. </p>
				
		</div>
		<div>
				<h3>Tom Lucitor</h3>
			<i>"The important thing is that you want to improve yourself!" - Star</i>
				<img src="images/tom.webp" alt="Star, Tom">
			<p>Tom is Star's on again, off again ex-boyfriend. After years of friendship, Tom has a difficult time letting go of Star and he often acts out. Initially, he followed Star to earth and instead found Marco... This caused many problems and Tom became Marco's bully for a time. Eventually as he grew as a person, he became less of an enemy and more of an ally. Soon, Tom and Marco became unlikely friends and Tom joined Star in her fight for monster equality.</p>
