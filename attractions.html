					<p><i><h4>American Ghost Town Touring</h4></i></p>
						<p><i>Anyone who finds themselves in the greater Pennsylvania area with an interest in dark and obscure history should visit Centralia, PA. Witness for yourself the post-apocalyptic landscape and eerie setting of one of Americaâ€™s modern day ghost towns. </i></p></div>

						<p><i><h4>Centralia Ghost Town Church </h4></i></p>
						<p><i>Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is a Ukrainian Greek-Catholic church. Out of five churches that called Centralia home, it is the only one that remains intact due to having miraculously been built atop a natural solid stone foundation. Had the church been situated above a coal seam, it would surely have met the same fate as the other buildings that once stood tall in the Borough of Centralia. </i></p></div>

						<p><i><h4>The Graffiti Highway</h4></i></p>
						<p><i>The graffiti highway functioned as a massive interactive art piece. It was covered in thousands of names and pieces of art made by tourists. The highway was eventually covered by dirt in an attempt to remove some of the more distasteful markings. This created a different sort of art piece, however. Now, hints of the colorful man-made wonder can be seen peeking through the earth and foliage. </i></p></div>

						<p><i>Bill's Old Bike Barn started out as a one room collection of retro motorcycles and grew into a 50,000 square foot showcase of over 200 different motorcycles. It has also begun to display various military uniforms, weapons, and other historical artifacts taken directly from the battlefields of World War 2. </i></p></div>

						<p><i><h4>Big Mine Run Geyser</h4></i></p>
						<p><i>Big Mine Run Geyser is an accidental man-made geyser that requires the water that comes from the mines for propulsion- unlike natural geysers that rely on underground aquifers. There is some debate as to how the geyser came to be. Some say the 300-foot hole of the geyser was originally made for ventilation, while other sources it was a burst pipe in the drainage systems that caused it to form. Regardless of what made the geyser appear in that specific location, the way it came to function is incredibly unique. When the mine was closed, large sections of the tunnels began to collapse, causing the mine to fill with water. The trapped water became pressurized and burst through an opening on the ground, effectively creating a manmade geyser. </i></p></div></div>
